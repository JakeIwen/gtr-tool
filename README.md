# GTRTool
GTR Tools is a is a feature-packed web application with many useful tools for aspiring guitarists and singer-songwriters. Initially developed to help guitarists better learn the many fingerings of basic three-note chords (triads), it has been expanded on to include more complex chords and scales. This app aims to provide tools that other online music tools do not, and as such, some understanding of basic theory may be beneficial to the user.

Additionally, GTRTool is a repository for uploaded chord-lyric text documents, enabling singer-songwriters to share and transpose songs, both publicly and privately.
