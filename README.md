GTRTool
====================

A web application to help guitarists visually understand and identify any of several thousand potential chord & scale formations on any part of the guitar fretboard.

Additionally, GTRTool is a repository for uploaded chord-lyric text documents, enabling singer-songwriters to share and transpose songs, both publicly and privately.
